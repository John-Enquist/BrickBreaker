# BrickBreaker
a 3 level game of brickbreaker I made contained within a single .js file

This will not work directly out of the box, however it will be pretty easy to set up if you know the basics of html.

Basically I am working on a website that will house my projects and this is one of them, however the webpages may contain
sensitive information so they cannot be uploaded at this point in time.

to get this working you will need a single html page with a canvas object in the body, as well as two images that will represent
the ball and the bricks.
